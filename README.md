# Observation Photo Manager

After a hike, you might come home with dozens, if not hundres of photo's of plants and insects. A good citizen scientist uploads them to a nature observation platform (waarneming.nl, observation.org, inaturalist.org).

But the insects are tiny and your pictures large.

Cropping them one by one with default Windows Photos, then saving these crops manually into another folder, and upload them one by one?

No more. At least, that is the goal of this project.

## Minimal requirements:

- A functional app
- Import a selection of photos
- Go by the photos one by one
- Convenient cropping
- Storing the crops into a folder

## Future ideas:

- Editing meta data of photo's
- Linking the cropped photo's to their original counterparts
- Automatically matching observations from the web to your pictures (based on time)
- Saving the crop dimensions and location so they can be applied retrospectively on the original, HD image
- ... and more? Who knows.

## Final note
This is my first real project. Hopefully I will manage to make something that will make my life a little bit easier!
